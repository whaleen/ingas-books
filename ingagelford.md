### Sophie Ma's Magical Glasses

Inga's concept for this book began to unfold 8 years ago. She felt moved to write a visual and verbal story, raising awareness by embracing the fun in life as told in simple, enjoyable terms.

> "I wanted to teach some of life's better discoveries through the medium of a children's story. Adults are leading our children into the future, so I wanted to write just as much for the adults as for the children, and to express values that uplift us all"

This book is part one in a trilogy so everyone can look forward to further adventures with Lydia and Grandmother Sophie Ma.
