Just a reminder that [Hannah](/hannah-patty/illustrator/) and [I](/inga-gelford/author/) will be at the McMinnville Farmers Market Thursday afternoon, Sept 6, 1-6 pm. If you haven't gotten your copy of [Sophie Ma's Magical Glasses](/book/sophie-mas-magical-glasses/) here is another chance! And also a chance to get a signed copy and to ask us questions, like what are the next books going to be about? I gave hints at the book signing last week. :)
